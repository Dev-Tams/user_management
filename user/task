Define a struct Product with fields ID int, Name string, Price float64, Tags []string.

Create a slice of a few products.

Marshal it to indented JSON and save to products.json.

Read products.json, unmarshal it back into a slice, and print the products.

Modify the JSON manually to add an extra field and use DisallowUnknownFields to see the error.
